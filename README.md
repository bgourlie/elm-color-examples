## Elm Color Examples

This is a simple project illustrating the type of reuse prescribed by
the Elm docs [here](http://guide.elm-lang.org/reuse/).  At a high level,
the UI is composed via reusable functions as opposed to components with
their own model and update functions.

### Running the project

    git clone https://github.com/bgourlie/elm-color-examples.git
    cd elm-color-examples
    elm-reactor
    
Then navigate your browser to `http://localhost:8000/Main.elm`.
